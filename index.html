						There's a design for each &amp; every one of us. You look at nature. Bird flies somewhere, picks up a seed, shits the seed out, plant grows. Bird's got a job, shit's got a job, seed's got a job.

						South Carolinian secessionists believed that the Constitution was a contract between the states, that the non-slaveholding states had broken it, &amp; that South Carolina could, on its own, decide that it was broken. The South Carolinian secessionists claimed that the Constitution had not designated an arbiter of controversies among two or more states, but it had. Article III of the Constitution gives the power to arbitrate such disputes to the U.S. Supreme Court. South Carolina's claim of no arbiter was false. South Carolina could have brought its complaints to the U.S. Supreme Court, but it chose not to. South Carolina's belief that the Constitution was a contract between the states was also false. The Constitution begins with "We the People" &amp; it was ratified by the states on behalf of, not in place of, the people. Finally, South Carolina's belief that the non-slaveholding states broke the Constitution is false. The non-slaveholding states were merely exercising their 10th Amendment rights to govern their own domestic affairs within the Constitutional structure.

						I don't know what my image is. I went to France to publicize 'Marvin's Room', &amp; one really smart young woman journalist said to me, 'You know, when I told people I was going to interview Meryl Streep, they were so excited ... all ze woman in my office, they love you so much. But ze men -- they are afraid of you.'
